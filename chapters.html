        <h1>Who is IFC?</h1>

        <p>The Interfraternal community at San Jose State is currently comprised of twelve individual chapters.
            Our chapters range in size, but all have incredibly diverse memberships.
            Each organization prescribes to its' own set of foundational values; values that are in place to help hold members to a higher standard and ultimately, produce better men.</p>
