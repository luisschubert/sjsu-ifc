        <h1>What is IFC?</h1>

        <p>The Interfraternity Council or IFC is the governing council for the twelve recognized, social fraternities at San Jose State University.
            The Interfraternity Council was created to provide a shared space for the associated fraternities to build community, self-govern, and set a standard for involvement for fellow students.
            The IFC at San Jose State is nationally affiliated with the North American Inter-Fraternity Conference, otherwise known as the <a href="http://www.nicindy.org/">NIC</a>.
            The NIC is the mother organization for hundreds of IFC's at Universities/Colleges across the nation.</p>

                <p>Do you want a website that is fast? Do you want a website that can scale to millions of individuals
                    instantly? Use what Google uses for their infrastructure: Golang, Google App engine, and Google
                    cloud storage.
                    This set of tools is the best of the best. When you learn to use this architecture, you will be
                    amazed
                    at how quickly your websites run. Golang is a "server side" language that will allow you to add
                    great
                    functionality, at fast speeds, to your sites. Caleb Doxsey will be teaching us the power of this
                    combination this summer.</p>
