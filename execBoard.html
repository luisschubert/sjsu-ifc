        <h1>What is IFC?</h1>

        <p>The Interfraternity Council or IFC is the governing council for the twelve recognized, social fraternities at San Jose State University.
            The Interfraternity Council was created to provide a shared space for the associated fraternities to build community, self-govern, and set a standard for involvement for fellow students.
            The IFC at San Jose State is nationally affiliated with the North American Inter-Fraternity Conference, otherwise known as the <a href="http://www.nicindy.org/">NIC</a>.
            The NIC is the mother organization for hundreds of IFC's at Universities/Colleges across the nation.</p>
